## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Shop won't open**
   - Use within 15 blocks of spawn point

2. **Can't capture flag**
   - Need to be within 1.5 blocks
   - Check if you're already carrying a flag

3. **Can't place blocks**
   - Block placement disabled during combat phase
   - In build phase, connect to team blocks

4. **Language won't change**
   - Server restart required after changing config.yml
